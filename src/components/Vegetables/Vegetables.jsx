                Why eating vegetables is important for children
Vegetables give your child energy, vitamins, anti-oxidants, fibre and water. They help protect your child against chronic diseases later in life, including heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

A healthy diet means eating plenty of vegetables, plus a wide variety of foods from the other main food groups.

The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend that children aged:
                    <li>1-2 years should have 2-3 serves of vegetables each day</li>
                    <li>2-3 years should have 2½ serves of vegetables each day</li>
                    <li>4-8 years should have 4½ serves of vegetables each day</li>
                    If your child finds it hard to eat enough vegetables, it’s important to keep encouraging them. If you help your child develop healthy eating habits now, it sets up healthy habits for life.
